# Stereo fix for updated Discord (October 2022)
> Download betterdiscord to stable, canary or ptb.
+ Drag both plugins into plugin folder of betterdiscord, enable both and check voice & video.
- Join call, and you should have stereo

P.S.A 
Bare in mind, the stereo is now in phase, meaning you won't be panned to the ear slightly, to get the old effect back, revert to old Discord voice modules.
